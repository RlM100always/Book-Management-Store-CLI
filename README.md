# 📚 **Book Store Management System** (CLI)

## 🚀 **Overview**
Welcome to the **Book Store Management System**! This is a Python-based **Command Line Interface** (CLI) application that allows users to easily manage a virtual bookstore. It provides functionality to:

- 📥 **Add books**
- 👀 **View books**
- 🗑️ **Remove books**
- 🔍 **Search for books**

All book data is stored and loaded from a file, ensuring data persistence. The system also prevents the duplication of books by their ISBN or Book ID and includes meaningful error handling for invalid inputs.

## 🎯 **Features**
- **Add Books**: Add books with details such as:
  - 📚 Title
  - ✍️ Author
  - 🆔 ISBN/Book ID
  - 🧑‍💻 Genre
  - 💸 Price
  - 📦 Quantity in stock
- **Prevent Duplicate Books**: Ensures each book has a unique ISBN/Book ID.
- **View Books**: View all books in a neatly formatted list.
- **Save to File**: All book data is stored in a `.json` file, making it persistent across program runs.
- **Load from File**: Automatically loads book data when the program starts.
- **Remove Books**: Remove books by ISBN/Book ID.
- **Error Handling**: Validates user inputs, ensuring correct data types (e.g., positive price and non-negative quantity).
